      <description>Zimbra Mail server Memory Tuning This utility will detect the amount of RAM in this system and make suggestions on the size of your java heap as well as the size of your innodb buffer pool. If you choose, it will also make these changes to your zimbra install. NOTE: For the changes to be effective, a mailboxd restart is required.
Copy the following script to any file memorytuning.sh
#!/bin/bash function ask_yes_or_no() { read -p &amp;quot;$1 ([y]es or [N]o): &amp;quot; case $(echo $REPLY | tr &#39;[A-Z]&#39; &#39;[a-z]&#39;) in y|yes) echo &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; ;; *) echo &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; ;; esac } echo &amp;quot;Checking total available ram&amp;quot; #echo free human readable cat /proc/meminfo |grep MemTotal #get memory total in bytes for calculation: MEMTOT=`cat /proc/meminfo |grep MemTotal |awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1` #memingig MEMGB=`expr $MEMTOT / 1048576` #echo &amp;quot;memeory total = &amp;quot;$MEMTOT #echo &amp;quot;mem total gb = &amp;quot;$MEMGB ##From the wiki: # On a &amp;lt;8GB system, set Java heap size percent to 20 and mysql innodb buffer pool to 20% of system memory.</description>

      <description>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is authentication protocol used to indicate to mail exchanges which hosts are authorized to send mail for a domain. It is defined using TXT record type, also has SPF record type. If you send email from xyz.com to tecnep.com, tecnep.com mail server will check if xyz.com is authorized for sending email or not. SPF record actually prevent email spoofing with spf records.
For example if tecnep.com has TXT record of :-</description>

      <description>Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and conformance (DMARC) is designed to protect your company&amp;rsquo;s email domain for being used for email spoofing, phishing scans. It is enhancement to existing email authentication technologies. DMARC uses existing two protocols SPF and DKIM and applies the policy for receiving email. Record is published in DNS record to specify which mechanism (DKIM, SPF or both) is employed when sending email from that domain, how to check &amp;lsquo;From:&amp;rsquo; field of the sender email.</description>

      <description>Keepalived provides simple and robust facilities for load-balancing and high-availability. The load-balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing Layer4 load-balancing.
Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load-balanced server pool according to their health. Keepalived also implements the VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 protocols to achieve high-availability with director failover.
You can allow firewall to accept vrrp protocol, which will allow you keepalive work accurately</description>

      <description>With the rich language more complex firewall rules can be created in an easy to understand way. The language uses keywords with values and is an abstract representation of ip*tables rules.
The rich language extends the current zone elements (service, port, icmp-block, icmp-type, masquerade, forward-port and source-port) with additional source and destination addresses, logging, actions and limits for logs and actions.
To accept ssh connection form a network only
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule=&#39;rule family=&amp;quot;ipv4&amp;quot; source address=&amp;quot;10.</description>
