	"content": "MailCleaner is a business anti spam gateway installed between your mail infrastructure and the Internet. It offers professional protection against viruses and eliminates up to 99% of spam.\nRequirements and planning Make sure that your hardware or Virtual Machine meets the minimum requirements:\n ▪ 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM ▪ 60 GB HDD ▪ 100 Mbps network card ▪ 2 Mbps network connectivity  Virtual Machine Download \u0026amp; Installation: Download the latest MailCleaner Virtual Machine corresponding to your virtualization environment here:https://www.mailcleaner.net/downloads/vm For installation instructions follow the README inside the ZIP file In my case, I had downloaded the appliance of. ova format and imported it to the VMware vSphere. After the successful installation, login to the virtual machine with user ‘root’ and password \u0026lsquo;MCPassw0rd\u0026rsquo;. After login, there will be asked to complete the wizards. There in the wizard, you need to select the keyboard language, hostname, IP address. You can change the root password later.\nNetwork environment: Please have on hand an IP address and a hostname to be dedicated to your MailCleaner. The hostname must be resolvable via DNS. Have a MX record of the IP in public DNS MailCleaner also needs Internet access on a number of ports. Make sure the firewall allows the all the ports required by Mailcleaner like SMTP, TCP, HTTPS, HTTP, LDAP, SSH etc.\nConfiguration after installation Once the installation of the Virtual Machine is finished, you can connect your favorite browser to the MailCleaner wizard configurator:https://yourhost:4242 Where your host refers to either the hostname or the IP address. MailCleaner by default is configured for DHCP, so if you have DHCP, it will get an address on your network and you could check your equipment to see what address it got. If you do not have DHCP on your network MailCleaner could be accessible on 192.168.1.42. You can set your own static IP from terminal of while installing the virtual appliance. In the URL mentioned above, you will be redirected to the wizard. Complete the wizard, as per your requirements.\nRegistration Registration for enterprises edition:\nIf you wish to get automatic updates for your MailCleaner, you may want to register with Mail Cleaner’s update service. Once you get the settings back from our service (client id, reseller id/password, etc.), you must connect your favorite browser to the MailCleaner web administration interface:https://yourhost/admin/ Where your host refers to either the hostname or the IP address you provided during the installation. The username is admin and the password is the one provided during the installation. Select “Configuration” menu, “Base system” sub-menu and “Registration” section You must fill all fields of this section with the information provided on your license certificate, by your reseller or directly by MailCleaner Sales Department.\nWhat is your reseller ID?\nThe reseller ID as assigned by MailCleaner Sales Department.\nWhat is your reseller password?\nThe password associated with the reseller ID as assigned by MailCleaner Sales Department. What is this client ID The client (or customer) ID as assigned by MailCleaner: 4-digit ID When finished, this step will register your MailCleaner installation with our update service? Available updates will then be fetched every 15 minutes. Anti-virus definitions are updated every hour by default.\nGui Configuration To activate the mailcleaner, it is required to properly configure the set up followed by mailcleaner GUI.\nGo to configuration =\u0026gt; Base system and configure Network, DNS, Localization, Date and time and Proxies as per your environment. Go to configuration =\u0026gt; General settings and configure defaults, Company, Quarantines, Periodic tasks, logging and archiving. After configuring Base system and General settings, it is more important to configure domains. Adding domain is most critical and backbone of the mailcleaner.\nTo configure the Domain, follow the below steps. Go to Configuration =\u0026gt; Domain, there you will see the Domain default setting and new domain. If you want the default configuration for all domains, configure in the default domain setting. Else, go to New Domain to add Domains. Add domain and submit. To configure the individual domains, go to list of the domain and select it. In the General fill the details of Aliases, postmaster address and support details. Submit the details and click next step. In the Destination server, fill the IP address of the mail server in which mail will be sent from mailcleaner. Choose smtp port as 25 and use multiple server as load balancing. Submit the details and test the destination then go to next step Next step is to configure Address verification. To configure address verification, go to Domain=\u0026gt; Select Domain=\u0026gt;Go to address verification. You will need to configure the following details.\nCallout Connector:- This is the method which is used to authenticate the address. Callout connector uses LDAP, SMTP, NONE and LOCAL protocols.\nLDAP Server: If you are configuring with LDAP, you will need to define the LDAP server from which LDAP authentication is done.\nBASE DN: Base DN uses domain controller for the address verification. If you are using Active directory to address verification, configure the Base DN as following For domain: abc.com.np Dc=abc, dc=com, dc=np\nBind User and Bind Password: Use the user and password of the LDAP server. Submit the details and test configuration.\nGo to Next Step and configure Preferences as per your requirement.\nIn the next step, will be redirected to Users Authentication. Any user defined in this step will authenticate users to the mailcleaner. To configure Users Authentication, follow the following steps.\nAuthentication Type: In the authentication type, we can see different authentication methods to get access. In my case, I have used ldap/Active Directory as an authentication method.\nAuthentication Server: Define the Authentication Server in this section. In my case, I have defined the IP address of LDAP server as Authentication Server.\nBASE DN: Define the domain name from which LDAP users will be authenticated. If you have domain abc.com.np, please select the base DN as: dc=abc, dc=com, dc=np\nBind User: Select the user from LDAP server as bind user. In my case, I have used administrator as bind user.\nBind Password: Use the password of the user from LDAP which is going to be used as bind user.\nUser Attribute: If you are using ldap/active directory as authentication type, use ‘SamAccountName’ as user attribute.\nConfigure Use SSL, Protocol version, Username Modifier, Address lookup as in above snapshot and submit the details. After submission test any user from ldap/active directory and test authentication. If the configurations are correct, you will see the connection successful message.\nAnother step to be configured is Filtering. In this section, you can define the different filtering methods for any domain. Configure the mailcleaner as shown in snapshot. Enable greylisting and whitelisting. If you want to select any domain to be not checked, mention it in the add an address. Another step is to configure outgoing relay. In the configuration you will need to generate DKIM signing. Make a configuration as shown in the above snapshot. You will need to enable BATV to generate DKIM signing. You will need to add this DKIM record to public dns.\nKeep the configuration of archiving and templates as per default.\nConfigure SMTP, Anti-spam, Content protection, accesses and Services as per your requirement.\n5.\tCluster Creation and Implementation To filter very large volume of email and/or for security and redundancy reasons, MailCleaner has been developed, from the very beginning, to work in a cluster configuration. One server, defined as the master, holds the database configuration and hosts the administrator and user web interfaces. The other servers in the cluster are defined as slaves. First, install each server independently.\nMaster Configuration: Use the script located in: /usr/mailcleaner/scripts/configuration/slaves.pl\n-The first time, you will have to set the real hostname of the master. The real hostname is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the master server. This name must be resolvable by DNS. Alternatively, you can use the master server's IP address in place of its name.\n▪Select option 1(fully qualified hostname or IP). By default, it is 127.0.0.1, which is to be changed in the case of a cluster.\n▪Select option 4 to add a slave and enter the hostname or IP address and the password of the server.\n▪Back in the main menu, hit q to apply changes.\nSlave Configuration: Use the script located in: /usr/mailcleaner/scripts/configuration/slaves.pl\nThe first time, you will have to set the real hostname of the slave. The real hostname is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of this slave. This name must be resolvable by DNS. Alternatively, you can use the server's IP address in place of its name\n\tSelect option 1(fully qualified hostname or IP). By default, it is 127.0.0.1.\n\tSelect option 5 to set this server as a slave. Enter the master's FQDN or IP address and password.\n\tBack in the main menu, hit q to apply changes.\nYou can now reach the admin interface of any server, but only the master will let you configure the system. The master is also the only server that allows users to access their quarantine.\nYou can now reach the admin interface of any host, but only the master will let you configure the system. It also is the only one that users can reach in order to access their quarantine.\nIn order to balance your incoming mail on the two (or more) nodes you can add a new MX record with the same priority pointing the second node. To test, go to user interface panel\nAfter clustering, go to URL of master cluster there you will see the stack of master and slaves.\nVerify the incoming and outgoing status of mails.

It also ensures that the system cannot be halted because of some partition running out of disk space. Splitting off /opt depends on a setup and is generally not useful, but not harmful either.\nPartitions should have hardened mount options:\nnoexec - deny binary execution nosuid - disable any binary to be suid root nodev - disable any block devices from being created. /boot : rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid /home : rw,nodev,nosuid /tmp : rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid /var :\trw,nosuid /var/log :\trw,nodev,noexec,nosuid /var/log/audit : rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid /var/www : rw,nodev,nosuid /dev/shm :\trw,nodev,noexec,nosuid  To check mount properties type mount :-\nmount | grep /dev/shm  Add /dev/shm with nodev nosuid and noexec in /etc/fstab.

It gives you fine control over all programs and daemons on their activities like communicating with out side programs or controlling whether to establish a outside connections for a particular program. The SELinux architecture provides general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role- Based Access Control, and Multi-Level Security.\nUmask The following files require umask hardening: /etc/bashrc, /etc/csh.cshrc, /etc/init.d/functions and /etc/profile.\nsed -i -e 's/umask 022/umask 027/g' -e 's/umask 002/umask 027/g' /etc/bashrc sed -i -e 's/umask 022/umask 027/g' -e 's/umask 002/umask 027/g' /etc/csh.cshrc sed -i -e 's/umask 022/umask 027/g' -e 's/umask 002/umask 027/g' /etc/profile sed -i -e 's/umask 022/umask 027/g' -e 's/umask 002/umask 027/g' /etc/init.d/functions  Grub password Anyone who have physical access to system can easily reset the root password. So we can avoid it by using the setting up of the grub password. Set grub password using :-\ngrub2-setpassword  Disable Core Dump A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file.

	"content": "While Installing Glassfish server may seems easy, sometimes you may face lots of issue due to glassfish server not being finely tunned. By default configuration, glassfish server comes with the minimal optipons configured. Here let's discuss about tunning the glassfish server for your environment. Let's first disscuss about the JVM options. bin/asadmin \u0026ndash;port list-jvm-options\na. List all the JVM Options configured for domain\nbin/asadmin --port \u0026lt;admin-port\u0026gt; list-jvm-options  b. From above command you will get a list of JVM options. Example being as follow.\n-Dorg.glassfish.additionalOSGiBundlesToStart=org.apache.felix.shell,org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime,org.apache.felix.gogo.shell,org.apache.felix.gogo.command,org.apache.felix.shell.remote,org.apache.felix.fileinstall -Djavax.management.builder.initial=com.sun.enterprise.v3.admin.AppServerMBeanServerBuilder -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/keystore.jks -server -DANTLR_USE_DIRECT_CLASS_LOADING=true -Dcom.ctc.wstx.returnNullForDefaultNamespace=true -Dfelix.fileinstall.bundles.startTransient=true -Xmx1500m -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/cacerts.jks -Dosgi.shell.telnet.ip=127.0.0.1 -Dfelix.fileinstall.log.level=2 -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -Djava.security.auth.login.config=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/login.conf -Dfelix.fileinstall.disableConfigSave=false -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djdbc.drivers=org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver -Djdk.corba.allowOutputStreamSubclass=true -Dosgi.shell.telnet.port=6666 -Dosgi.shell.telnet.maxconn=1 -Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=all -Djava.ext.dirs=${com.sun.aas.javaRoot}/lib/ext${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.javaRoot}/jre/lib/ext${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/lib/ext -Djava.security.policy=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/server.policy -Dgosh.args=--nointeractive -Dcom.sun.enterprise.config.config_environment_factory_class=com.sun.enterprise.config.serverbeans.AppserverConfigEnvironmentFactory -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Djava.endorsed.dirs=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/modules/endorsed${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/endorsed -Dcom.sun.enterprise.security.httpsOutboundKeyAlias=s1as -Dfelix.fileinstall.poll=5000 -Dfelix.fileinstall.bundles.new.start=true -XX:NewRatio=2 -Dfelix.fileinstall.dir=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/modules/autostart/  c. Now from above results, let us take multiple JVM options which are of utmost importance for your performance of the server.\n Heap Memory.  Heap memory is the run time data area from which the memory for all java class instances and arrays is allocated. From this we can see the importance of the heap memory. In glassfish we can configure two important jvm options for heap memory. One is initial heap size which is refered as \u0026ldquo;-Xmx1500m\u0026rdquo; and another is maximum heap size which is refered as \u0026ldquo;-Xms1500m\u0026rdquo;.\nd. Encrypted Password for DataSource\n  View List for encrypted password\n bin/asadmin --port \u0026lt;admin-port\u0026gt; list-password-aliases    This command will prompt you to enter the admin username \u0026amp; password, after successful authentication, you can see the list of encrypted password which were previously created.\n Create encrypted password\n bin/asadmin --port \u0026lt;admin-port\u0026gt; create-password-alias    This command will prompt you to enter the admin username \u0026amp; password, after successful authentication, it will ask you for \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; of Alias Password and then it will ask you to enter the desired \u0026ldquo;Password\u0026rdquo; two times. If the entered password matches two times then, it will generate a message with \u0026ldquo;Password-Alias created successfully\u0026rdquo;. Now, you can use the recently created password-alias \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; for Database Connection at JDBC Connection Pool. You need to replace the password at password field with this \u0026ldquo;${ALIAS=alias_name}\u0026quot;.\n Delete encrypted password\n bin/asadmin --port \u0026lt;admin-port\u0026gt; delete-password-alias    This command will prompt you to enter the admin username \u0026amp; password, after successful authentication, it will ask you for \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; of Alias Password that you wish to delete.\n by : Ritu Singh\n"

MIBs group together particular types of devices. MIB has a unique identifying number, as well as an identifying string. Individual devices in MIB has a unique Object Identifier, or OID\nVersions SNMPV1 SNMPv1 offers weak security features.\n  Managers can authenticate to agents without encryption when requesting information.\n  Anyone with access to the network could run “sniffing” software to intercept information about the network.\n  Unauthorized device can easily pretend to be a legitimate manager when controlling the network.\n  SNMPv1 uses certain default credentials which is rarely changed by admins\n  SNMPV2   SNMPv2 offered some security enhancements\n  But community access string to permit access to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) via SNMPv1 still existed in SNMPv2\n  SNMPV3 SNMPv3 is the latest version of SNMP.
